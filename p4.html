<h2>Articulated Robots

An articulated robot is the type of robot that comes to mind when most people think about robots. Much like CNC mills, articulated robots are classified by the number of points of rotation or axes they have. The most common is the 6-axis articulated robot. There are also 4- and 7-axis units on the market

</h2>
<h2>SCARA Robots

A Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm (SCARA) is a good — and cost-effective — choice for performing operations between two parallel planes (e.g., transferring parts from a tray to a conveyor). SCARA robots excel at vertical assembly tasks such as inserting pins without binding due to their vertical rigidity.

</h2>
<h2>Delta Robots

Delta robots, also referred to as “spider robots,” use three base-mounted motors to actuate control arms that position the wrist. Basic delta robots are 3-axis units but 4- and 6-axis models are also available.

By mounting the actuators on, or very close to, the stationary base instead of at each joint (as in the case of an articulated robot), a delta robot’s arm can be very lightweight. This allows for rapid movement which makes delta robots ideal for very high-speed operations involving light loads.

</h2>
<h2>Cartesian Robots

Cartesian robots typically consist of three or more linear actuators assembled to fit a particular application. Positioned above a workspace, cartesian robots can be elevated to maximize floor space and accommodate a wide range of workpiece sizes. (When placed on an elevated structure suspended over two parallel rails, cartesian robots are referred to as “gantry robots.”)

</h2>
<h2>Drones: Also called unmanned aerial vehicles, drones come in different sizes and have different levels of autonomy. Examples include DJI’s popular Phantom series and Parrot’s Anafi, as well as military systems like Global Hawk, used for long-duration surveillance.</h2>
