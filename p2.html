    <td>Automates the processes.Artificial Intelligence allows robots to develop repetitive, routine and process optimization tasks automatically and without human intervention.</td>
    <td>Data availability. Often,data is presented in isolation across companies or is inconsistent and of low quality, presenting a significant challenge for companies seeking to create value from AI at scale. In order to overcome this barrier, it will be vital to draw up a clear strategy from the outset so thatAI data can be extracted in an organized and consistent manner.</td>

    <td>Enhance creative tasks. AI frees people from routine and repetitive tasks and allows them to spend more time on creative functions.</td>
    <td>Lack of qualified professionals. Another obstacle that often occurs at the business level for the adoption of AI is the scarcity of profiles with skills and experience in this type of implementations. It is crucial in these cases to have professionals who have already worked on projects of the same magnitude.</td>

    <td>Repetitive jobs

The same old task, a task that doesn’t add value is of no use. Also, repetitive jobs are monotonous in nature and can be carried out with the help of machine intelligence. Machines think faster than humans and can perform various functions at the same time. It can be employed to carry out dangerous tasks and its parameters are adjusted. This is not possible with humans as their speed and time can’t be calculated on the basis of parameters.

</td>
    <td>High cost

It’s true that AI comes with a high cost, but there is no such thing as a free lunch too. It requires huge costs as it is a complex machine. Apart from the installation cost, its repair and maintenance also require huge costs. The software programs need frequent upgradation and cater to the needs of the changing environment.

Also, if there is a breakdown, the cost of procurement is very high. With that, recovery requires huge time too.
